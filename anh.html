		<h2 class="title">1981 | Theatrical re-release</h2>
		<img data-img2="images/anh2/crawl.jpg" src="images/anh2/crawll.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The original 1977 theatrical crawl did not begin	with an Episode title or number; these were added in the 1981 theatrical	re-release.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh2/crawl1.jpg" src="images/anh2/crawl2.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The spacing of the words in the title crawl has changed to avoid single words on a line ending a paragraph. Also note that the capitalization of "Rebel" was fixed in the second paragraph so that it matches the first.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh2/crawl21.jpg" src="images/anh2/crawl22.jpg" />
		<p class="description">Another example of the 1981 reshuffling of the crawl to avoid ending a paragraph with a single word on a line.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh2/crawl221.jpg" src="images/anh2/crawl222.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The last paragraph of the crawl was left largely	unchanged, though the spacing of the ellipsis has been widened to make the text more block-shaped.</p>
		<hr />
		<h2 class="title">1997 | Special Edition release</h2>
		<img data-img2="images/anh/fox_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/fox_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The original 1977 version of Star Wars began with the painted 20th Century Fox logo, which was updated in 1997 to the new digital logo that identified Fox as a News Corporation company.</p>
		<hr /><img data-img2="images/anh2/lf.jpg" src="images/anh2/lf2.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The plain green Lucasfilm Limited card was replaced in 1997 with an animated presentation, though the 'new' logo had been in	existence since before 1977.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh2/skydesert.jpg" src="images/anh2/skydesert2.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The sky in the original 1977 version of this shot was changed to better match continuity with other shots in the desert sequence.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh2/sandcrawler.jpg" src="images/anh2/sandcrawler2.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The original shot of the sandcrawler model was replaced with a new shot of the same model moving across a miniature landscape in 1997.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/moisture_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/moisture_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The original framing of this shot was scaled down, with the image area extended with a digital matte painting that added more vaporators and more sandcrawler than was practically built on location.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/speeder_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/speeder_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">All the landspeeder hovering shots where enhanced in 1997 with more realistic digital shadows. The original 1977 versions had thick hand-animated shadows.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/report_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/report_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">For this exterior shot, two digital dewbacks and a stormtrooper rider were added.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/hangar_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/hangar_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">In 1997, the original matte painting of the Falcon was replaced with one that used a digital ship model as a foundation. Also, the Death Star hangar design was changed to match the one seen in Return of the Jedi.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/duel_anh_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/duel_anh_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">Text.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/deadend_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/deadend_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">In 1997, this scene was enlarged with a digital matte set and bluescreen-photographed and replicated extras as stormtroopers and Imperial officer.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/temple_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/temple_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The 1977 matte painting of the Yavin temple was replaced with a more realistically detailed digital one, complete with slowly opening hangar door and a second speeder. The foreground plants are the same.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/panback_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/panback_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The Special Edition replaced two separate shots witha n arcing camera move impossible to achieve with late 1970s motion control. It reversed the order of the shots as well.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/panfront_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/panfront_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The 1997 shot also included Yavin 4 in the background.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/locksf_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/locksf_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The S-foil separation shot was enhanced to include a greater sense of forward motion.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/done_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/done_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The shot of these Rebel ships fleeing from the doomed Death Star was made more dynamic in 1997.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/celeb_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/celeb_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The rather obvious matte painting soldiers in the foreground were replaced with digitally composited extras in 1997.</p>

		<h2 class="title">2004 | Special Edition DVD release</h2>
		<img data-img2="images/anh/gffa_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/gffa_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">Text.</p>
		<br />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/sunset_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/sunset_ld.jpg" />
		<br />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/suns_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/suns_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The 2004 Special Edition removed some occluding landscape
		from the famous twin sunset scene, to match continuity to the long shot
		which has an unobstructed view of the suns.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/training_dvd.jpg" src="images/anh/training_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">Text.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/dianoga_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/dianoga_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The original dianoga was enhanced in 2004 to feature a blinking and moving eye.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/text_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/text_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">In 2004, the original English text on the tractor beam display was translated to Aurebesh, the Star Wars font.</p>
		<hr />
		<h2 class="title">2011 | Special Edition Blu-ray release</h2>
		<img data-img2="images/anh/training_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/training_dvd.jpg" />

		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/anh/blast_bd.jpg" src="images/anh/blast_dvd.jpg" />
		<p class="description">Luke's lightsaber color when training with the remote was fixed from green to blue.</p>
