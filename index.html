	<p>"The original inspiration for bringing the films out again was the fact that it was the 20th anniversary of the original release of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. I had an ulterior motive that I've been thinking about for a long time -- actually ever since the films were finished -- which is there were various things, specially in the original film, that I wasn't satisfied with. Special effects shots that never really were finished, scenes that I wanted to include that couldn't have been included for some reason, mostly money and time. And I really wanted to 'fix' the film and have it be completed."</p>
