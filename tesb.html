	<p>It is a dark time for the<br />
	Rebellion. Although the Death<br />
	Star has been destroyed,<br />
	Imperial troops have driven the<br />
	Rebel forces from their hidden<br />
	base and pursued them across<br />
	the galaxy.<br />
	<br />
	Evading the dreaded Imperial<br />
	Starfleet, a group of freedom<br />
	fighters led by Luke Skywalker<br />
	has established a new secret<br />
	base on the remote ice world<br />
	of Hoth.<br />
	<br />
	The evil lord Darth Vader,<br />
	obsessed with finding young<br />
	Skywalker, has dispatched<br />
	thousands of remote probes into<br />
	the far reaches of space....<br />

		<img data-img2="images/tesb/window_bd.jpg" src="images/tesb/window_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">Though much of the original matte painting was retained in the new shot, the main apartment building has been changed.</p>

        <h2 class="title">2004 | Special Edition DVD release</h2>
		<img data-img2="images/tesb/snow_bd.jpg" src="images/tesb/snow_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">Almost all of the composites against the white snowy background were redone to better preserve the color quality of the model and its blurred edges.</p>
		<hr />
        <img data-img2="images/tesb/bridge_bd.jpg" src="images/tesb/bridge_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The edge of the matte painting originally had heavy black seams surrounding the viewport that Darth Vader stands at; the redone composite cleans up these edges.</p>
		<hr />
        <img data-img2="images/tesb/cockpit_bd.jpg" src="images/tesb/cockpit_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">In the original shot, Luke was translucent (note the speeder visible through his helmet). The other speeders also had heavy matte lines.</p>
		<hr />
        <img data-img2="images/tesb/cable_bd.jpg" src="images/tesb/cable_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">More snowspeeder opacity and edge-fixing thanks to digital compositing. The tow-rope has been thickened, and the speeder's shadow redone to better match the color and contour of the land.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/tesb/transport_bd.jpg" src="images/tesb/transport_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The Rebel transport is better matched to its surrounding, and its hand-drawn shadow is redone to better match the lighting of the scene.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/tesb/escape_bd.jpg" src="images/tesb/escape_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">Garbage matte artifacting around all the ships has been cleaned up.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/tesb/emp_bd.jpg" src="images/tesb/emp_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The original Emperor has been replaced by Ian McDiarmid in makeup for the 2004 DVD release. Also, the seam between the matte painting and live action set has been softened.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/tesb/cclanding_bd.jpg" src="images/tesb/cclanding_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The background skyline has been changed, though the foreground platform and Falcon elements are reused from the original. What was once hand-drawn retro rockets have been replaced with composited steam elements.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/tesb/cc_bd.jpg" src="images/tesb/cc_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The original establishing shot of Cloud City had a cloud car fly towards camera. In the new version, introduced in 1997, the car is gone, but now the camera moves in towards the city, while a refinery platform floats nearby.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/tesb/balcony_bd.jpg" src="images/tesb/balcony_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">Text.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/tesb/kiss_bd.jpg" src="images/tesb/kiss_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The original architecture did not portray a penthouse apartment, so the view out the windows had visible spokes, as opposed to open sky with a cloud car.</p>
		<hr />
		<img data-img2="images/tesb/corridor_bd.jpg" src="images/tesb/corridor_ld.jpg" />
		<p class="description">The outer wall has been turned into a window looking at the Slave I.</p>
		<hr />
		<h2 class="title">2011 | Special Edition Blu-ray release</h2>

		<img data-img2="images/tesb/window_bd.jpg" src="images/tesb/window_dvd.jpg" />
		<p class="description">A reflection has been added to the main apartment's window.</p>
